MASTERMIND

This is a logic game. The "master"(in this case, the computer) makes a pattern of 4 colors out of a list of
6 possible colors (0-4 repeated colors). The "student" (user) guesses the four colors. The master gives
a coded response: red "peg" for right-color-right-place, white "peg" for right-color-wrong-place,
nothing if that color is not in the pattern.

For this version of the game, only the first letter of each color is used.
For example, the master's pattern is RED WHITE BLUE WHITE (indicated by RWBW).
You guess: WBYW (for: WHITE, BLUE, YELLOW, WHITE).
The computer gives the following response: red, white, white.
For the same pattern, if you guess: RRYG (for: RED, RED, YELLOW, GREEN) the response would be: red.

Please note: the computer gives you all the red "pegs" first, then the white ones.
This does not indicate the location at which the correct colors sit. That is for you to figure out.

Your "score" is the number of guesses it takes until you figure it out. The lower the score, the better you did (like golf).

One hint per game is available. If you choose to get a hint, the program will tell you what color
is in the first spot but, it will cost you two guesses on your score.
